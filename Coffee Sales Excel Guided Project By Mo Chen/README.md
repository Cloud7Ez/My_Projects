## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with creating a working sheet and transforming the datasets presented in different sheets into "Tables". After this we start getting to explore the data and check for any data quality issues.
1.	Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors.
2.	Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3.	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
4.	Used Xlookup function to find the customer name, email, country and loyalty Card from the customers table.
5. Used Index function to find the coffee type,roast type, size and unit price from the products table.
6.	Created “Sales” column by multiplying Unit price and Quantity column and Coffee Type Name and Roast Type Name columns by using IFS function.

## Data Analysis
3 pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between sales and other factors such as date, customers, country. 

## Data Visualization

Finally, the dashboard was created by inserting and customizing the pivot charts of corresponding pivot table on a separate sheet named “Dashboard”. For user friendly and interactive experience 3 "Slicers" and 1 “Timeline” were added.

Below is a snapshot of the final dashboard in Excel.
